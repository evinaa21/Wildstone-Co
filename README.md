Database Schema:
Users Table (employees, managers, admins):

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin', 'manager', 'employee') NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);
Shifts Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE shifts (
    shift_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    shift_name VARCHAR(100),
    shift_start TIME,
    shift_end TIME,
    date DATE,
    status ENUM('open', 'closed', 'assigned') DEFAULT 'open'
);
Employee Shifts Table (for assignments):

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE employee_shifts (
    shift_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (shift_id, user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (shift_id) REFERENCES shifts(shift_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
Attendance Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    attendance_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    shift_id INT,
    clock_in DATETIME,
    clock_out DATETIME,
    status ENUM('present', 'absent', 'late') DEFAULT 'present',
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (shift_id) REFERENCES shifts(shift_id)
);
Leave Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE leave_requests (
    leave_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    leave_type ENUM('sick', 'vacation', 'personal'),
    status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
Backend Logic:
1. Admin Panel (PHP - shift and user management)
Admin can CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) shifts and assign employees to shifts.

Admin can view all employees' attendance and leave records.

Example PHP Code (Admin managing shifts):

php
Copy
Edit
// Fetch all shifts
$query = "SELECT * FROM shifts";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

while ($shift = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    echo "Shift Name: " . $shift['shift_name'] . "<br>";
}

// Add new shift
if ($_POST['add_shift']) {
    $shift_name = $_POST['shift_name'];
    $shift_start = $_POST['shift_start'];
    $shift_end = $_POST['shift_end'];
    $date = $_POST['date'];

    $query = "INSERT INTO shifts (shift_name, shift_start, shift_end, date) VALUES ('$shift_name', '$shift_start', '$shift_end', '$date')";
    mysqli_query($conn, $query);
}
2. Manager Panel (PHP - assigning employees to shifts)
Managers can assign employees to shifts and track attendance.

Use AJAX to dynamically load available shifts and employees.

3. Employee Panel (PHP - viewing and confirming shifts)
Employees can see their assigned shifts and confirm or reject them.

Employees can also mark their attendance for each shift (clock-in/clock-out).

Frontend (UI Design):
Dashboard for Admin/Manager/Employee:

Admin Dashboard: View all shifts, employees, and attendance at a glance.

Manager Dashboard: Assign shifts and track attendance for their team.

Employee Dashboard: View assigned shifts, confirm attendance, and request leaves.

Shift Scheduling Interface:

Use a calendar view to display shifts.

Use AJAX to update the schedule in real-time without refreshing the page.

Attendance and Leave Management:

Attendance: Employees can clock in and clock out. Managers can approve absences.

Leave Requests: Employees can apply for leave, which managers or admins can approve.

AJAX Notifications:

Real-time shift changes or reminders via AJAX.

For example, when a shift is updated or a new schedule is posted, the employee receives an immediate notification.

AJAX for Real-time Updates:
Real-Time Shift Assignment (AJAX):

When a Manager assigns an employee to a shift, use AJAX to update the shift status on the front-end.

Example: When a shift is assigned, the Employee's shift list updates automatically without reloading.

javascript
Copy
Edit
// AJAX request to assign employee to a shift
function assignShift(shift_id, user_id) {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'assign_shift.php',
        method: 'POST',
        data: { shift_id: shift_id, user_id: user_id },
        success: function(response) {
            $('#shift-list').html(response);
        }
    });
}
Real-Time Attendance (AJAX):

Employees can clock in and out, and the status will be updated in real-time.

Example: When an employee clocks in, their status (Present/Absent/Late) is updated instantly.

javascript
Copy
Edit
// AJAX request to clock in/out
function clockInOut(shift_id, user_id) {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'clock_in_out.php',
        method: 'POST',
        data: { shift_id: shift_id, user_id: user_id },
        success: function(response) {
            $('#attendance-status').html(response);
        }
    });
}
Additional Features:
Leave Requests:

Employees can request leave, and Managers can approve or reject it.

Leave status (approved/rejected) will be displayed on the employee dashboard.

Overtime Tracking:

Track overtime hours for employees based on their shift length.

Example: If an employee works beyond the shift end time, the overtime hours are calculated and added to their report.
