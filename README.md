Key Features & Requirements Breakdown
User Management:

Admin:

Manages employee profiles (e.g., name, role, contact details, work hours).

Creates and edits shifts (e.g., morning shift, night shift).

Approves or rejects time-off requests submitted by employees.

Monitors attendance (checks if employees are on time and if they clock in/out).

Generates reports for attendance, work hours, and time-off usage.

Employee:

Views their shift schedule (which days and times they are working).

Requests time off (vacations, sick days, etc.) via an approval workflow.

Logs their attendance by clocking in and out when they start and finish their shifts.

Shift Scheduling:

CRUD for Shifts: Admin can create, edit, and delete shifts, such as morning, evening, or night shifts, and assign employees based on their availability.

Automated Shift Assignment: Admin can input employee availability and the system automatically assigns shifts, ensuring fair distribution (and also considering roles, like part-time or full-time).

Shift Notifications: Employees get notifications for shift assignments and any changes made to their schedule.

Attendance Tracking:

Employees clock in/out to log their attendance.

Admin can monitor attendance patterns (e.g., late arrivals, missed shifts).

Attendance reports showing employee work hours (weekly/monthly) for payroll calculations.

Time-Off Management:

Employee Requests: Employees can request time off for vacation, sick leave, etc., via an interface.

Approval Workflow: Admin can approve or reject these requests based on availability and staffing needs.

Time-Off History: Admin can track the total time off each employee has taken.

Reporting and Analytics:

Attendance Reports: Admin can generate reports based on daily, weekly, or monthly attendance, highlighting tardiness, absenteeism, and overtime.

Employee Work Hours: Report showing the total work hours for each employee (useful for payroll).

Shift Allocation Report: Report on how shifts are distributed among employees, ensuring fairness.

Workflow
Employee Profile Management:

Admin creates employee profiles, assigning roles (e.g., cashier, supervisor) and setting working hours or preferred shifts.

Employees can log into their account to view schedules, request time off, and update personal details.

Shift Assignment:

Admin creates shifts and assigns them to employees based on availability.

The system can suggest shift allocations based on employee preferences or availability, reducing manual work.

Time-Off Requests:

Employees can submit leave requests. Admins receive notifications for approval or rejection.

If a leave request is approved, the employee is removed from the shift schedule for that period.

Attendance Logging:

Employees clock in and out, either manually or via an automated system (e.g., fingerprint, RFID card, etc.).

Admin can monitor the logs and generate reports based on the data.

Technologies & Tools
Backend: PHP (for handling user authentication, CRUD operations, etc.)

Database: MySQL (for storing employees, shifts, time-off requests, attendance)

Front-End: Even though you mentioned not wanting client-side, basic HTML/CSS for the admin panel and employee views would still be essential to display data (you could always focus on a simple admin panel without heavy front-end design).

Security: Use PHP sessions for login management and validation, ensuring that users can only access their own data (admins can access all data).

Email Notifications: Send email notifications when shifts are assigned or when time-off requests are approved/rejected.

Possible Enhancements
Mobile Integration: Although you're focusing on the backend, you could allow employees to receive SMS or push notifications for shift changes or time-off approvals.

Advanced Reporting: Use charts and graphs (e.g., with libraries like Chart.js) to visualize attendance, work hours, and time-off requests.

Self-Management Features for Employees: Let employees swap shifts with one another (with admin approval) or adjust availability on the system.
